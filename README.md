# ACCELEROMETER_BASED_3D_AIR_MOUSE
Accelerometer Based 3d Air Mouse
# ABSTRACT
We have seen different types of Human Interface Devices(HIDs),for example mouse and
keyboard.In older versions of computer mouse,optical sensors were used to detect movement
relative to a surface,thus they require smooth surface to function properly.
These mice can work with only two coordinates.With advancements in technology,we are
now talking about 3D user interfaces(3DUIs).So,we must start developing a 3D HID device which
has the capability to work with all coordinates.In this project we are going to make 3D wireless HID
device that will give you a whole new experience of using computers and playing online games. With
this device,you will be able to control computers and Smart phone by just moving your hand in air.
you can draw any design by moving your hand in the air.
